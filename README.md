# GoCache
Geolocation iOS application made using Swift 2 & Xcode 7.  

GoCache was the first iOS application I made during my Digital media Design, University course. 

‘GoCache’ app allows its users to post their memorable
moments, the users can post images, letters, stories etc. in a geocache, each cache can be
viewed by other users on the app. However, if a cache is made private it can only be viewed
by those who have an account with ‘GoCache’.The iOS App notifies their user when they
are in range of a cache location, once the notification is opened, it launches the app which
takes you to the radar search, where the cache is located and your distance away from the
cache. When the user walks towards the cache the navigation arrow at the bottom of the
radar is green which means you are on the right path, but when you go off track it flashes
red and notifies you about the direction you’re going in. As you get closer to the cache the
cache locator starts flashing faster. Once the user has got to the cache it pops up with
another notification in which they can dismiss or view the hidden cache. If they touch the
view, it pops up with the cache on the page in which the users can read and see the
images, once you close the cache you have a navigation at the top of the page. The
navigation bar consists of Timeline, Locator, Search and Cache management. When the
user is inactive for a certain amount of time, it takes the user back to the Timeline which tells
the user what other users have been active and where they have been active (just the area
not specific location).
